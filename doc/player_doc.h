 * @brief The @ref CAPI_MEDIA_PLAYER_MODULE API provides functions for media playback and controlling media playback attributes.
 *
 * @section CAPI_MEDIA_PLAYER_MODULE_HEADER Required Header
 *    \#include <player.h>
 *
 * @section CAPI_MEDIA_PLAYER_OVERVIEW Overview
 * The Player API provides a way to play multimedia content. Content can be played from a file, from the network, or from memory.
 * It gives the ability to start/stop/pause/mute, set the playback position (that is, seek), perform various status queries, and control the display.
 *
 * Additional functions allow registering notifications via callback functions for various state change events.
 *
 * This API also enables collaboration with the GUI service to present a video.
 *
 * @subsection CAPI_MEDIA_PLAYER_LIFE_CYCLE_STATE_DIAGRAM State Diagram
 * Playback of multimedia content is controlled by a state machine.
 * The following diagram shows the life cycle and states of the Player.
